# FirstProject
TODO: Our first group collaboration project

## Getting Started
Welcome to our first project.  Head over to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectJava/) and introduce yourself in the sub.  That is where most of our communication will be happening for now.

## Usage
These projects will be for beginners to practice working in group setting building software together.  Learning and challenging ourselves together.  

## Contributing
1. Head to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectJava/) and introduce yourself
2. See if you'd like to contribute to any of the current projects
3. Request to join a project

##Project Resources
We will primarily be working with the spring framework for the first project since it'll be covering a lot of web based activities.  Here are some resources to get started.  We can use Tomcat for starters and go from there.  
[Spring Boot Documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/), 
[Spring MVC Documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle), 
[Thymeleaf Template engine](http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/2.1/thymeleafspring.html), and
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).  There have been several generous members of Reddit that have offered to help mentor and guide our projects, so head to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectJava/) and post any questions you have.
